# KPack - Lots-In-One AddOn Collection!

Currently, this pack contains 48 modules in a single addon, some of them are from existing addons (_credits to all their respective authors_) and some are completely custom made.

I have been collecting these modules over the last years, randomly and just including them within the TOC file until I decided to organize everything in a better way.

Lots of modules/addons required lots of rewritting and others really needed to be rewrote from the group up, keeping the concept but with different code.

Most of the modules have slash commands, they can be enabled or disabled but there are some that don't have an option to toggle them, so, if there is a module that you don't want to use, simply comment its line out in the `Load.xml` file or delete its file within the `Modules` folder.

## How to install

1. Download the package.
2. Extract it inside AddOns folder.
3. Rename it to `KPack`.
4. Enjoy!
